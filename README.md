## What I’m About

I’m taking the unconventional path: **rigorous fundamentals before abstractions**.

Instead of rushing to frameworks, I’m building from the ground up—writing C to understand memory and pointers, mastering SQL before ORMs, learning why algorithms work instead of memorizing patterns.

**Why?** Mathematics taught me that shortcuts hide crucial details. In software, those details are where performance lives and bugs hide.
