## 🚀 About Me

I'm taking the unconventional path into software engineering: **rigorous fundamentals before abstractions**.

Instead of rushing to frameworks, I'm mastering the foundations—C programming to understand memory management, SQL before ORMs, algorithms from first principles. My mathematics background taught me that shortcuts hide crucial details. In software, those details determine performance and reliability.

**Currently:**
- 🎓 Completing **IEFP Level 4 Programming Certification** (Programmer/Informatics)
- 💻 Self-studying **École 42 curriculum** (C, Unix, systems programming)
- 🏢 Internship: Apr-May 2026 (programming position)
- ✈️ Relocating to Connecticut, USA in June 2026

## 💡 What Drives Me

**Mathematics → Software Engineering**

My math degree taught me to:
- Break complex problems into fundamental components
- Prove solutions work before implementing them
- Value deep understanding over surface-level knowledge
- Persist through difficult concepts until they click

Now I'm applying this mindset to software:
- Understanding how memory works (pointers, malloc, stack vs heap)
- Learning why algorithms perform the way they do (Big O, trade-offs)
- Building from scratch to understand abstractions (writing my own printf before using libraries)

**Goal:** Become a software engineer who understands systems at every level—from bits to databases to user interfaces.
