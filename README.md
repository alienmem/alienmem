# Hi, I’m Antonio Cardoso 👋

**Mathematician → Software Engineer | Building from First Principles**

*“Most developers learn frameworks. I’m learning how computers actually work.”*

**Currently:** C programming (42 School) • Python & DSA • CS fundamentals

## What I’m About

I’m taking the unconventional path: **rigorous fundamentals before abstractions**. Instead of rushing to frameworks, I’m:

- Writing C through School 42’s curriculum (self-study) to understand memory, pointers, and system-level programming
- Building Python fundamentals through structured coursework
- Mastering SQL and databases (completed Harvard’s CS50-SQL)
- Understanding how computers work from the ground up

**Why?** Mathematics taught me that shortcuts hide crucial details. In software, those details are where performance lives and bugs hide.
