# Hi, I'm Antonio Cardoso ðŸ‘‹

### Mathematician â†’ Software Engineer | Building from First Principles

*"Most developers learn frameworks. I'm learning how computers actually work."*

**Currently:** C programming (42 School) â€¢ Python & DSA â€¢ CS fundamentals

## ðŸŽ¯ What I'm About

I'm taking the unconventional path: **rigorous fundamentals before abstractions**. Instead of rushing to frameworks, I'm:

- Writing C through School 42's curriculum (self-study) to understand memory, pointers, and system-level programming
- Building Python fundamentals through structured coursework
- Mastering SQL and databases (completed Harvard's CS50-SQL)
- Understanding how computers work from the ground up

**Why?** Mathematics taught me that shortcuts hide crucial details. In software, those details are where performance lives and bugs hide.

### ðŸ”§ Systems Programming
**School 42 Curriculum (Self-Study)**

Building C fundamentals through rigorous problem-solving.

**Active:**
- [42-school-roadmap](https://github.com/alienmem/42-school-roadmap) â€” C Piscine âš¡

**Learning:** Memory, pointers, low-level systems

**Next:** libft, ft_printf, pipex

### ðŸ’» Software Engineering
**10-Month Roadmap to Job-Ready**

Structured path: fundamentals â†’ full-stack â†’ production.

**Active:**
- Python for Everybody âš¡
- CS50-SQL (Harvard) âœ…

**Learning:** Python, DSA, web development

**Next:** CLI projects, LeetCode, FastAPI/React

## ðŸ’¼ Work

### CS50-SQL (Harvard) âœ…
Completed comprehensive database course: relational modeling, query optimization, transactions, indexing, and normalization. All problem sets and final project finished.

**Skills:** SQL â€¢ Database Design â€¢ Query Optimization â€¢ Performance Tuning

---

## ðŸ§° Stack

**Languages:** C â€¢ Python â€¢ SQL  
**Tools:** Git â€¢ Linux â€¢ Neovim â€¢ PostgreSQL  
**Learning:** DSA â€¢ Web Dev â€¢ Systems Programming

## ðŸŽ“ Background

**Education:**
- **B.S. Mathematics** â€” Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade do Porto
- **School 42** â€” Self-study (ongoing)

**Why Software Engineering?**  
Mathematics taught me rigorous problem-solving and proof-based thinking. Now I'm channeling that into building reliable, efficient software by mastering fundamentals first.

**Certification:**
- Cisco C Essentials I âœ…

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

**The Long Game:**  
Most bootcamp grads can glue frameworks together. I'm taking the harder route: understanding how things work at the fundamental level.

I'm learning to manage memory manually before using garbage-collected languages. Understanding what happens beneath SQL queries. Knowing *why* algorithms have their complexity, not just memorizing Big O.

**Result:** Slower to build MVPs, faster to debug production issues.

**Math â†’ Code:**  
- Break problems into provable steps
- Consider edge cases obsessively
- Understand *why*, not just *how*

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Standards

Every project follows this structure:

```
project-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md      # What, why, how, learnings
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore     # Clean repo
â”œâ”€â”€ src/           # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/         # Proving it works
â””â”€â”€ docs/          # Deep dives (optional)
```

**Every repo includes:**
âœ… Clear problem statement  
âœ… Implementation approach  
âœ… What I learned  
âœ… How to run it  
âœ… Meaningful commits

## ðŸŒ± Current Focus & Roadmap

**Month 1 (Now):**
- Python for Everybody â†’ mastery
- C Piscine exercises â†’ daily practice
- First project: CLI Task Manager

**Months 2-3:**
- 100 LeetCode problems (Arrays, Hash Maps, Stacks)
- Data Analyzer project (pandas, matplotlib)
- Web fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS/TypeScript)

**Months 4-6:**
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, authentication
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind
- Full-stack projects deployed to production

**Months 7-10:**
- Advanced algorithms & system design
- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, testing
- 250-300 LeetCode total
- 6 production-ready projects

**End Goal:** Job-ready software engineer with deep fundamentals and proven ability to ship.

## ðŸš€ Project Pipeline

Six production-ready projects planned:

1. **CLI Task Manager** (Python) â€” File I/O, data structures
2. **CSV/Excel Analyzer** (Python/pandas) â€” Data manipulation
3. **Portfolio Site** (TypeScript/Next.js) â€” Web fundamentals
4. **Blog API** (FastAPI/PostgreSQL) â€” Backend + auth
5. **Production API** (Docker/CI/CD) â€” DevOps
6. **Full-Stack App** (Next.js + FastAPI) â€” Complete system

All will be deployed, documented, and showcase-ready.
